# DupeNameGenerator
Oxygen Not Inlcuded mod that generates random names for your dupes rather than using the standard ones.
Each dupe will get a name and surname or title.
There is a 4% chance that a generated name will have a title instead of a surname.

## Installation
Download the lastest version from Releases and extract into your Oxygen Not Included mod directory located at `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\mods\Local`
If the folder `\Local` does not exist create it.
The final directory should be `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\mods\Local\DupeNameGenerator`.
Start ONI, navigate to Mods and enable the DuplicateNameGenerator mod.

## Customize names
In the DupeNameGenerator folder there is another folder `NameLists` that contains the list of names the mod uses to generate duplicant names.
Simply modify the lists to add more names, surnames or titles.
